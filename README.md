# Module 9 Challenge - SQL 

The SQL challenge presented a true test of my proficiency in utilizing JOINS, soemthing I was really looking forward to getting more experience with. Starting with the diagram was crucial to keeping all of the relations between the tables straight in my head.

The schema was pretty straightforward; the creation of tables through the use of the CREATE TABLE statement and then importing the info from the CSV files. I referred back to the initial diagram a lot when it came to the Query portion of the challenge. It was a really helpful tool to know where SELECT, FROM, and JOINS were coming and going.

I leaned on the recorded class lectures and extra materials from the instructor for this challenge. The usual lectures and then the supplimental content provided for what may have not been covered during the lecture hours.
